# Symphonic

## Usage
- Compile it with `cargo build --release` or get a prebuilt from [releases](https://git.xeondev.com/fadia-rs/symphonic/releases)
- Replace `HTGameBase.dll` in the game folder
- That's all

## Platform Support
Since this patch completely skips any anticheat (Tencent ACE) initialization, it works on both Windows and Linux (wine)
